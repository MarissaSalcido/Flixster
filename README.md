## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API. 

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [] Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
* [] Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading
* [] Improve the user interface through styling and coloring
* [] For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. 
     Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.
